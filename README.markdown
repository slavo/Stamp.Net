Introduction
============
Stamp.Net is a library inspired by the [Stamp] [stamp_src] library for the Ruby language. Its purpose is to format string representation of dates in .NET by an example, rather than the standard .NET format strings. For more information on the original Stamp library please see the [git repository] [stamp_src].

Installation
============
The repository contains two Visual Studio projects - a class library for the utility itself and a Console application to illustrate its usage. The are two ways to use the library:

1. From source - just copy the Stamp.Net project, add it to your solution and add a project reference to any other project you are going to call it from.
2. As a binary - Build the Stamp.Net project and copy the Stamp.Net.dll file. Add a normal reference to the DLL in the project that is going to use it.

Usage
